# GravityFlip-A-Reality-Bending-Platformer-Where-Up-Is-Optional-And-Physics-Is-Constantly-Lying-Again
Flip the world in this fast paced platformer where gravity is your main weapon. With a single button, switch up, down, left, or right to run on walls, ceilings, and floors. Dodge traps, solve clever puzzles, and master momentum to survive increasingly intense levels. Each stage challenges timing precision, and creativity as reality constant shifts.
